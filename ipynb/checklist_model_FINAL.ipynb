This includes vectorising the goal, agenda, and text and training a Title and Ingredient autoencoder.\n","\n","The model in \"Build the Model\" consists of the checklist cell (class ChecklistCell), which implements the computation in the paper, and the outer framework (buildChecklistModel) which embeds the ChecklistCell in Keras's functional API.\n","\n","We train the model in \"Build Model\", and make predictions in the \"Predictions\" section. We implemented beam search, but we found more natural results by playing with the temperature parameter in our non-beam-search text generation. The Hierarchical Generation section uses the output of rnn_word_punct_emoji_ingr_online as the title and ingredients input of the Checklist model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PGr91nvM99Qg"},"source":["# Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MHNxwcSJndpu","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622683086337,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":36358,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Kong","photoUrl":"","userId":"07341482379174037459"}},"outputId":"499e7cb8-5981-4781-bc76-ac2d5f9e2e63"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PmB2fPCGZc73","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622683093495,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":4501,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Kong","photoUrl":"","userId":"07341482379174037459"}},"outputId":"92afbbed-a7e4-4dfc-c25c-9df4e89ab2a2"},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from tensorflow.keras import backend as K\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","from keras.utils.vis_utils import plot_model\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import pathlib\n","import os\n","import pickle\n","import random\n","\n","import re\n","import spacy\n","\n","from collections import namedtuple, defaultdict\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","tqdm.pandas()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tqdm/std.py:658: FutureWarning: The Panel class is removed from pandas.
