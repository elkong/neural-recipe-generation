TITLE
Guacamole Deviled Eggs with Garbanzo Beans, Polloar and Basil Cheese Mix

INGREDIENTS
• 2 scallions, chopped
• 1 large Swiss cheese, or to taste
• 10 cups water
• 1/2 lemon, juiced

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in water, stirring occasionally, until al dente, and cool enough to coat completely. Reserve 2 cups bacon fat; mix in sour cream, white sugar, fish sauce, and water until smooth.
‣ Pour sauce over broccoli. Toss gently to evenly coat. Continue to cook until cheese has melted and sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes.
‣ Drain the shells in a colander, diping the bottom of pan, and return to heat. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar or butter. Serve hot or at room temperature.
