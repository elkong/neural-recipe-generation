TITLE
Turkey Nacho Baked Beans with rosemary Vinegar pepper flakes and Olive Oil, and pasta sauce if desired

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Place the garlic and salt to opposite side of a large bowl with the chopped onion, parsley, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.
‣ Place the beef stew meat in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), and the juices run clear. As the meat syrup is cooked, then pour over the top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with sliced carrot slices.
