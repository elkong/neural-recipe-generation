Orange Smoothie). Toast the top pineapple halves in the oven or grill until sausage is no longer pink in the edges, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in 1 tablespoon peanut butter, and season with salt to taste.
‣ To Make the toast Cream Sauce: Whisk together the strawberries, honey, mustard, and sugar with the 1/3 cup orange juice until smooth. Pour into a chilled saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer the pasta or in a bowl of ice water for at least 20 minutes, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl. Stir in 1/3 cup butterscotch puree. Pour into a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish with the remaining 1 cup milk or enough to cover the top. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese over the bottom of the pan.
‣ Bake at 300 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Cool pan just until the muffin cookies are set and slightly browned. Cool for 10 minutes before slicing.
