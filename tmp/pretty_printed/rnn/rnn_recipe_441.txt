INGREDIENTS
• 2 cups buttermilk mixed with canola oil, divided and cream cheese as necessary, using sour cream, mix well. Gradually whisk in milk and peanut butter mixture, stirring frequently until smooth.

‣ Slice strawberries into 1/2 inch slices; top with Parmesan cheese and peaches.
‣ Begin by placing pepper halves with the remaining crumbs. Spread with grape juice and drizzle liberally with Chopped French Bread Mayo.
‣ To make the canned peanut butter, place a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter; add the cream cheese and continue to cook and stir until melted, about 5 minutes.
‣ Stir in the cherries and serve hot or cold. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon maple syrup or colored sugar or a slice of thyme.
