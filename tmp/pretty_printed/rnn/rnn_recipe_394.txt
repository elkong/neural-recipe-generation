TITLE
Veal Rolls Stuffed with Prosciutto and Cheese Blanc and white Cheddar Cheese Dip

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread the remaining sugar in a small baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup of the green olives between paper towels and place in a large bowl.
‣ In a large bowl, mix together the flour with the yeast mixture until the dried beaten eggs are well coated. Pour honey mixture into a large bowl. Beat the egg yolk into the sour cream. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup melted butter, then beat in the remaining sugar and 1 egg, stirring after each addition. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan leaving 2 inches apart. Bake until the edges are golden brown, and the top quiche is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes before storing in an airtight container for medium flavor.
