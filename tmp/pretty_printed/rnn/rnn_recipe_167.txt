Cubanstyle Fried Chicken Sausage Stuffing Cheese Dip evenly in a large bowl, and season with salt and pepper to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
â€£ Place couscous in a small saucepan with enough water to cover the eggs. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook to set below the boil. When the water is boiling, stir in the eggs and butter, and adjust the heat to medium low. Do not allow the eggs to simmer. Pour the egg mixture into a large bowl, and stir in cream sauce, and season with salt and pepper. Drop the crab mixture around the whole heavy saucepan and stir to combine. Pour over the couscous. The batter will turn spoon and bubbly. When mixture begins to thicken, stir in the chicken and raisins. Ladle into bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese and cilantro to serve.
