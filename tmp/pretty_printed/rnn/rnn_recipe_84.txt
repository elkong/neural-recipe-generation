INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
‣ Spoon the cauliflower out onto a medium mixing bowl. Pour in the vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. Mix together and cover with plastic wrap.
‣ Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the top of the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the crushed grated Cheddar cheese. Cover and cook 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the honey mustard and hot sauce. Serve warm. Top with the remaining parsley and lemon zest.
