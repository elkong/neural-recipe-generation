INGREDIENTS
• 6 pork chops
• salt and pepper to taste
• garlic powder to taste
• 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
• 1 large onion, sliced 1/4 inch thick
• 2 cubes chicken bouillon
• 2 cups boiling water

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and then dredge in 1/2 cup flour. In a skillet over medium heat, lightly brown chops in a small amount of oil.
‣ Place chops in slow cooker, and top with onion slices. Dissolve bouillon cubes in boiling water and pour over chops. Cover, and cook on Low 7 to 8 hours.
‣ Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
‣ After the chops have cooked, transfer chops to the oven to keep warm. Be careful, the chops are so tender they will fall apart. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour with the sour cream; mix into meat juices. Turn slow cooker to High for 15 to 30 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened. Serve sauce over pork chops.
