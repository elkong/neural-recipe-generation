INGREDIENTS
• 1 cup all-purpose flour
• 2 tablespoons cornstarch
• 1 teaspoon baking powder
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1 egg
• 1 cup beer
• 1/2 cup plain yogurt
• 1/2 cup mayonnaise

• 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
• 1 quart oil for frying
• 1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2 to 3 ounce portions
• 1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas
• 1/2 medium head cabbage, finely shredded

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ To make beer batter: In a large bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Blend egg and beer, then quickly stir into the flour mixture (don't worry about a few lumps).
‣ To make white sauce: In a medium bowl, mix together yogurt and mayonnaise. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny. Season with jalapeno, capers, oregano, cumin, dill, and cayenne.
‣ Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
‣ Dust fish pieces lightly with flour. Dip into beer batter, and fry until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Lightly fry tortillas; not too crisp. To serve, place fried fish in a tortilla, and top with shredded cabbage, and white sauce.
