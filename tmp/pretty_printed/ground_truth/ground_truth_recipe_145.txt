Aussie Chicken

INGREDIENTS
• 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness
• 2 teaspoons seasoning salt
• 6 slices bacon, cut in half
• 1/2 cup prepared yellow mustard
• 1/2 cup honey
• 1/4 cup light corn syrup
• 1/4 cup mayonnaise
• 1 tablespoon dried onion flakes
• 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
• 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
• 2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
• 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning salt, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until crisp. Set aside.
‣ In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, honey, corn syrup, mayonnaise and dried onion flakes. Remove half of sauce, cover and refrigerate to serve later.
‣ Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the breasts in the skillet and saute for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned. Remove from skillet and place the breasts into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Apply the honey mustard sauce to each breast, then layer each breast with mushrooms and bacon. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.
‣ Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear. Garnish with parsley and serve with the reserved honey mustard sauce.
