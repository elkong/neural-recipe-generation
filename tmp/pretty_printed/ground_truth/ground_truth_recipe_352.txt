Easy Lemon Cookies

INGREDIENTS

• 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
‣ Pour cake mix into a large bowl. Stir in eggs, oil, and lemon extract until well blended. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough into a bowl of confectioners' sugar. Roll them around until they're lightly covered. Once sugared, put them on an ungreased cookie sheet.
