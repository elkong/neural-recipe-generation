Cream Puffs

INGREDIENTS
• 2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
• 2 cups heavy cream
• 1 cup milk
• 1/2 cup butter
• 1 cup water
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1 cup all-purpose flour
• 4 eggs

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and refrigerate to set.
‣ Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
‣ In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil. Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.
‣ Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Centers should be dry.
‣ When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.
