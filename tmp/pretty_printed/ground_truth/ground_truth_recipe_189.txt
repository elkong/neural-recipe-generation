TITLE
Donut Muffins

INGREDIENTS
• 1/2 cup white sugar
• 1/4 cup margarine, melted
• 3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
• 1/2 cup milk
• 1 teaspoon baking powder
• 1 cup all-purpose flour
• 1/4 cup margarine, melted
• 1/2 cup white sugar
• 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 mini-muffin cups.
‣ Mix 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup margarine, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Stir in the milk, then mix in the baking powder and flour until just combined. Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about half full.
‣ Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
‣ While muffins are baking, place 1/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Remove muffins from their cups, dip each muffin in the melted margarine, and roll in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Let cool and serve.
