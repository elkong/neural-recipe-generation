TITLE
Delicious Raspberry Oatmeal Cookie Bars

INGREDIENTS
• 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
• 1 cup all-purpose flour
• 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
• 1/8 teaspoon salt
• 1 cup rolled oats
• 1/2 cup butter, softened
• 3/4 cup seedless raspberry jam

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 8 inch square pan, and line with greased foil.
‣ Combine brown sugar, flour, baking soda, salt, and rolled oats. Rub in the butter using your hands or a pastry blender to form a crumbly mixture. Press 2 cups of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread the jam to within 1/4 inch of the edge. Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the top, and lightly press it into the jam.
‣ Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool before cutting into bars.
