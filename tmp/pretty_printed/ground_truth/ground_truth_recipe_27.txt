TITLE
Ang's Balsamic Maple Chicken

INGREDIENTS
• 2 tablespoons maple syrup
• 1 tablespoon balsamic syrup
• 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
• 2 pinches cayenne pepper
• 1 pinch ground white pepper
• 1 pinch ground nutmeg
• 1 pinch ground dried chipotle pepper
• 3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
• 1 tablespoon olive oil

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Whisk maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, and chipotle pepper together in a small bowl until rub is smooth. Coat chicken on all sides with rub.
‣ Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
