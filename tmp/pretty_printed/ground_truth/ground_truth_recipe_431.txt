TITLE
To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo

INGREDIENTS
• 24 ounces dry fettuccini pasta
• 1 cup butter
• 3/4 pint heavy cream
• salt and pepper to taste
• 1 dash garlic salt
• 3/4 cup grated Romano cheese
• 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
‣ In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.
‣ Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.
