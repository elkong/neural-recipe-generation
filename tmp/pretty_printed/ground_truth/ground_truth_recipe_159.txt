Cajun Chicken Pasta

INGREDIENTS
• 4 ounces linguine pasta
• 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, sliced into thin strips
• 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
• 2 tablespoons butter
• 1 green bell pepper, chopped
• 1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
• 4 fresh mushrooms, sliced

• 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
• 1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguini pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
‣ Meanwhile, place chicken and Cajun seasoning in a bowl, and toss to coat.
‣ In a large skillet over medium heat, saute chicken in butter until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add green and red bell peppers, sliced mushrooms and green onions; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat, and stir in heavy cream. Season the sauce with basil, lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder and ground black pepper, and heat through.
