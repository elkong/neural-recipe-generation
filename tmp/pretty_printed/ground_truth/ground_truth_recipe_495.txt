Sage Pork Chops

INGREDIENTS
• 2 teaspoons salt
• 1 teaspoon dried sage
• 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
• 6 center cut bone-in pork chops
• 2 tablespoons butter
• 1 cup water
• 2 cubes beef bouillon

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Combine the salt, sage and black pepper in a small bowl and rub on both sides of the chops. Melt the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium high heat and saute the chops for 5 minutes per side, or until well browned.
