TITLE
Brandy Flamed Peppercorn Steak

INGREDIENTS
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 clove garlic, minced
• 1 teaspoon salt
• 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
• 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
• 1 pound flank steak
• 1 cup chopped peppercorn
• 1 cup pitted and chopped peppercorns
• 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
• 1/4 cup butter
• 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
• 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
• 1/4 cup brown sugar
• 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
• 1/4 cup white sugar
• 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
• 1 tablespoon soy sauce
• 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
• 1 tablespoon brown sugar
• 2 tablespoons sesame oil
• 1 teaspoon honey

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and flank steak. Cook until the steak is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Stir in the peppercorn and peppercorns, and cook until the peppercorns soften, about 2 minutes more.
‣ Melt the whipping cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder, white vinegar, brown sugar, white vinegar, and sugar. Stir in the honey and 1 tablespoon of distilled white vinegar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the sugar has dissolved, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in the apple cider vinegar and soy sauce. Season with ginger and brown sugar.
