TITLE
Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin

INGREDIENTS
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 clove garlic, minced
• 1 teaspoon onion powder
• 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
• 2 cups red or green beans, rinsed and drained
• 1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
• 1 teaspoon ground cumin
• salt and pepper to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion powder, and cumin. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
‣ Place the tenderloin into the skillet and coat with the onion mixture. Cover and cook 5 minutes, or until the pork is no longer pink in the center. Stir in the beans, and cook until the beans have absorbed the onion mixture and the pork is tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
