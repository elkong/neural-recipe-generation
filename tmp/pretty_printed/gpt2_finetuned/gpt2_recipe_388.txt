TITLE
Peanut Butter Candy Bars

INGREDIENTS
• 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
• 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
• 1/2 cup shortening
• 1/2 cup peanut butter
• 2 cups rolled oats
• 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
‣ Sift the flour, brown sugar and shortening into a large bowl. Beat the oatmeal into the flour mixture alternately with the peanut butter, mixing just until incorporated. Fold in the oats and chocolate chips. Spread evenly into the prepared baking pan.
‣ Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup peanut butter and remaining chocolate chips. Return to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes more. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
