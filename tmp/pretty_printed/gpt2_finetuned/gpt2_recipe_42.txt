INGREDIENTS
• 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
• 1 tablespoon olive oil
• 1/4 cup butter, melted
• 1 tablespoon soy sauce
• 2 tablespoons honey
• 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

‣ Place the sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, cool, and chop.
‣ Heat the olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the soy sauce, honey, pepper, garlic, cumin, salt, and cornstarch.
