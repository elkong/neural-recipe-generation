• 2 cups all-purpose flour
• 1 cup milk
• 2 cups sour cream

‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour and baking powder; set aside.
‣ In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and eggs until light and fluffy. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Stir in the sour cream and cream cheese. Blend in the pecans and vanilla. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
