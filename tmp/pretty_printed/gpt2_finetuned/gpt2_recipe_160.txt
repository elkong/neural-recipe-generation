• 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
• 1 cup butter
• 3/4 cup packed brown sugar

‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch round cake pan.
‣ In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, salt and baking soda. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the brown sugar, white sugar and egg and mix until well blended. Mix in the water and vanilla, then stir in the chopped nuts. Spread batter into the prepared cake pan.
‣ Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
