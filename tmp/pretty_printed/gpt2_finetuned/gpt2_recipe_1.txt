INGREDIENTS
• 2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped corned beef
• 1 cup all-purpose flour
• 1 cup vegetable oil
• 1/4 cup water
• 1 (1 pound) loaf day-old French bread, cut into 1 inch pieces
• 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
• 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
‣ Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the corned beef, and cook until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain off any excess grease. Stir in the flour, and cook until it starts to thicken.
‣ In a bowl, mix the water, oil, and butter. Add the bread pieces, and stir until evenly coated. Spread the bread mixture into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with mint and mint leaves.
‣ Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bread is golden brown and bubbly.
