TITLE
Grilled Chicken Salad with Seasonal Fruit Dip

INGREDIENTS
• 2 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness
• 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
• 1/2 cup mayonnaise
• 1/4 cup chopped celery
• 1/4 cup chopped walnuts
• 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives
• 1/4 cup fresh sliced strawberries
• 1/4 cup chopped pecans
• 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
‣ Mix the red wine vinegar, mayonnaise, celery, walnuts, kalamata olives, strawberries, pecans, and feta cheese in a bowl; toss to coat.
‣ Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
