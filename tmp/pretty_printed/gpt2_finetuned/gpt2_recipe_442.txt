TITLE
Bruschetta I

INGREDIENTS
• 2 cups Italian bread flour
• 2 cups all-purpose flour
• 1 tablespoon salt
• 1/4 cup vegetable oil
• 1/4 cup water
• 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
• 1 egg
• 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
‣ In a large bowl, mix together the bread flour, flour, salt, oil, and water. Cut in the butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over the dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using a cookie cutter, using a thin spatula. Place on prepared baking sheet.
‣ Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from oven, and let cool slightly before slicing into 2 inch squares.
