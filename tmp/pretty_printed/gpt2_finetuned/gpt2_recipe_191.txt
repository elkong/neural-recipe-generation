TITLE
Savory Sweet Potato Hash

INGREDIENTS
• 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
• 1 tablespoon butter
• 1/2 cup milk
• salt and pepper to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
‣ Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the milk, and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the butter is melted, and the mixture begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sweet potato slices, and continue cooking until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes more.
