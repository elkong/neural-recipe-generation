TITLE
Tortellini Southwest

INGREDIENTS
• 2 (16 ounce) packages fresh tortellini pasta
• 1 cup butter
• 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
• 2 cups milk
• 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
• salt and pepper to taste

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
‣ Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, and cook until the mixture begins to thicken. Gradually whisk in evaporated milk, and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until thickened, and thickened, about 10 minutes.
‣ Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
‣ To assemble, spread a layer of the cooked tortellini onto a baking sheet.
‣ Bake in the preheated oven until warmed through and the pasta is cooked through, about 15 minutes.
