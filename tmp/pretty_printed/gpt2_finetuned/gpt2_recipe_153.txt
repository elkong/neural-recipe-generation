TITLE
Roasted Garlic Flat Iron Steak

INGREDIENTS
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 clove garlic, minced
• 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
• 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
• 1 (2 pound) flat-dish steak
• 1 cup chopped celery
• salt and pepper to taste
• 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
‣ Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the garlic and red pepper flakes in the hot oil until the garlic is fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
‣ Place the mushrooms, steaks, celery, salt, and pepper into the skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in the extra virgin olive oil, and continue cooking and stirring until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes more.
‣ Transfer the steaks to a baking dish, and roast in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are hot, the meat is no longer pink inside, and the celery is tender, about 30 minutes.
