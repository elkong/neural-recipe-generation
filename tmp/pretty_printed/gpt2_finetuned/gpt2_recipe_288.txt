TITLE
Country Fried Steaks with Sweet Onion Gravy

INGREDIENTS
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 large onion, chopped
• 1/2 pound baby back pork chops
• 1/4 cup steak sauce
• 1/4 cup honey
• 2 tablespoons soy sauce
• 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
• 1 teaspoon onion powder
• 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
• 1 teaspoon celery seed
• 1 teaspoon garlic powder
• 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
• 1 teaspoon sesame oil
• 2 tablespoons honey
• 1 cup sesame seeds

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in the pork chops, and cook until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the steak sauce, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, celery seed, garlic powder, and vegetable oil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, until thickened.
‣ Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
‣ Remove pork chops from the marinade, and discard remaining marinade. Grill chops until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side, basting with the remaining marinade.
