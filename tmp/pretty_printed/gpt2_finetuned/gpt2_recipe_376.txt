TITLE
Greek Tzatziki Sauce

INGREDIENTS
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 pound ground beef
• 1/2 onion, chopped
• 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
• 1 clove garlic, minced
• 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
• 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
• 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
• 1/4 teaspoon red pepper seasoning
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1 teaspoon dried oregano
• 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
• 1 pinch cayenne pepper

INSTRUCTIONS
‣ Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ground beef and onion in the hot oil until the meat is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Stir in the green pepper and garlic, and cook until the pepper is completely browned, about 5 minutes more. Mix in the parsley, basil, red pepper flakes, red pepper seasoning, salt, oregano, and black pepper; cook and stir until the basil has softened and turned transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cayenne pepper and parsley; cook and stir until the cayenne has softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in the beef mixture and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beef is no longer pink in the center, about 5 more minutes.
