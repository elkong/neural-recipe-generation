‣ Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Add the sesame oil, lemon juice, water, and pork ribs. Cook, stirring, until the pork is no longer pink in the center. Season with soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder.
