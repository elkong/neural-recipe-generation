‣ Mix together the ground beef, sesame seeds, ketchup, rice vinegar, vegetable oil, ground ginger, salt, black pepper, garlic, onion powder, cinnamon, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, garlic powder, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and cornstarch in a large bowl until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Form the mixture into a loaf and place into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
