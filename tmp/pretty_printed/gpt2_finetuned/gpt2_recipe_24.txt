‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.
‣ In a large bowl, stir together the oats, flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nuts. Cut in the buttermilk until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
‣ In a separate bowl, stir together the eggs, oil and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture. Stir into the wet ingredients until just incorporated. Divide dough into prepared pans.
‣ Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
