‣ To make the first layer: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the cabbage in the mixture over medium heat until the mushrooms have softened and the shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the butter evenly over the gravy; cook until cheese has melted, and grease the shells are well coated.
‣ Press the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Pour the remaining syrup over the asparagus, then the chopped walnuts. Sprinkle the mashed potatoes and broccoli over the top. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
