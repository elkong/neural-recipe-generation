Ugly Tomato Sauce: In a saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Cook shrimp until just tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pecans, and corn kernels with cold water to completely cool.
‣ Stir the shredded zucchini, and the remaining chopped broccoli together in a bowl. Stir in the raisins and cheese.
‣ Place the potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
‣ Bake in preheated oven until topping is lightly browned and the cheese melts, about 8 minutes. Stir remaining sprinkles or chunks of fresh mushroom mixture and place them in a heatproof bowl. Pour the remaining sauce over the onions and mix and serve.
