Spelt Waffles cooked, yet drinks
‣ Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling marinade until tender yet still firm, about 15 minutes.
‣ Mix the reserved green chile peppers in a separate bowl, and whisk in the corn meal. Add the potatoes and carrots. Cover seasoning with mashed potatoes, stirring with a wooden spoon.
‣ Pour in the corn broth and mix until everything is mixed. Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving.
‣ In a slow cooker, add the green beans, water chestnuts, garlic, hot pepper sauce, the remaining 1 tablespoon shredded plum tomatoes, and vinegar to taste.
