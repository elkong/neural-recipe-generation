‣ Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
‣ Reserve 3 tablespoons fish sticks from one end of each burger to form potato. Spread it on top.
‣ Bake chops on the preheated oven, until fish flakes easily with a fork about 125 degrees F (230 degrees C) and begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 45 minutes. They can be ready to use.
