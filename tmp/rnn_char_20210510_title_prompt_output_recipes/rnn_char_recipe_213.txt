Magic Spice Cake: Thinly sliced potato chips in thickness, and set aside.
‣ To Make Frosting: In a large bowl, mix together sugar, cinnamon, and margarine; continue to process until smooth. Stir in mashed bananas, ham, bacon, onion, flax seeds, mayonnaise, chickpeas, lemon juice, and orange juice. Season with salt and pepper, and shop up the flour and continue cooking until the mixture thickens. Sprinkle over whipped topping. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes.
‣ While the turnovers are softened, place in a large bowl of ice water to cool slightly. Pour the drink mixture over the chicken, add the half of the cranberries, and top with the parmesan cheese.
