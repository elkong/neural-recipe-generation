Banana Ice Cream Cheese Frosting: Sweet potatoes with 1 can apple cider or cherry bread, cheese, tomato and pear in a small bowl. Serve peanut butter over cooked.
‣ In a large saucepan, bring the milk and half the lentils to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in the peas, cover, and keep at a roasting pan. Set aside.
‣ In a large stockpot or Dutch oven or large non-stick skillet, heat 1/2 inch of oil over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned (about 5 minutes).
‣ Place the sliced onions in a steamer and cook over medium-high heat until cracked on the outside, about 5 minutes. Add the peas, and cook uncovered until onions are tender, about 2 minutes. Pour into a small bowl and stir in the bacon, cheese and heavy cream. Serve with wedges of the toasted croutons.
