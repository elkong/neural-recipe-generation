Ice Cream Sundaes:
‣ Melt margarine in a saucepan over lower third of the water. Stir cheese into dry mixture, then transfer to a baking dish.
‣ Stir together the white sugar and chopped dill. Set aside.
‣ Brush one side of each springform from the strawberry jam on both sides of each disk. Arrange coated chicken on a cookie sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Check for doneness.
‣ Skin egg, mound onto sheets, and spread with the top of the cakes. Bake for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
