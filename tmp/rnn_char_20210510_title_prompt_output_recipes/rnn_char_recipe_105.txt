Steak Marinade may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
‣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
‣ Combine sweet potatoes, sugar, oil and salt in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in milk, egg, and buttermilk. Beat until well blended. Mix in buttermilk and remaining reserved milk, and pour into prepared pan.
‣ Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let stand at least 40 minutes at room temperature.
