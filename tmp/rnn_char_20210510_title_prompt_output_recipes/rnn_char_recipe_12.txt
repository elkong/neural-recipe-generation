Potato and Vegetable Frittata cheese in a covered container, add 1 cup celery salt and 1 cup of spinach - a splash balsamic vinegar to 2 cups.
‣ Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish, cover, and refrigerate until cold.
‣ Place potatoes into a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium.
‣ Remove from heat, cover and let stand 10 minutes. Remove from heat completely, bring to boil. Add chicken, mix with boiling water, and return to soft peaks. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until enough to double in center.
