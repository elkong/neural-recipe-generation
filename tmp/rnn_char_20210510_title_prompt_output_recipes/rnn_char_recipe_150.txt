Chicken Karahia Sauce:
‣ In a large bowl, combine the Mountain and brown sugar. Stir in the remaining white wine and red bell pepper until well blended. Pour the molasses mixture into the zucchini shells, and cover evenly with aluminum foil. Cook for 3 hours.
‣ Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). (If desired) before storing, roll the dough into a ball. Roll the loaf into thirds. Push into a rectangle layer and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
‣ Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until lightly browned. Cover with foil to keep warm while hot.
