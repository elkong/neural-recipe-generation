Adobo Quesadilla Burger with Grilled Corn Salsa, and just remaining sauce for serving (optional). Stir cooled tuna and blue cheese into the lemons.
â€£ Spread 1 teaspoon of the pesto onto each cheese on the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Spread 1/4 cup of bell pepper over the top of the marinara sauce; spread the cheese mixture over the filling. Place the foil and bake in preheated oven for 20 more minutes, or until heated through. The loaf will be ready to serve.
