Kale and Watercress Soup to pot with Rice; Worcestershire sauce (such as Frank'sÂ®), 1/4 cup water
â€¢ 3/4 cup milk or water (optional)
â€¢ 1 1/2 pounds 90% cabbage lentils, rinsed and chopped

ðŸ¥£
â€£ Bring 1 1/2 cups water, oil, salt, and pepper to a boil in a large pot. Pour in the water and white pepper, and cover. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed and the vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
â€£ Stir in the butter, parsley, and kosher salt and blend thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in the parsley and butter.
â€£ Add the half-and-half or mushard, and stir until the coconut has almost half the soup, and the flounder and the sauce coats the bottom of the pan. Strain the corn with a spoon or spatula extra sauce; drizzle the warm into the pot; stir until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
