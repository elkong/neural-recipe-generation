Hawaiian Wedding Cake III

🥑
• 1 (3 pound) bottle dark rum
• 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
• 1 1/2 tablespoons rose water
• 1 teaspoon white sugar
• 1 teaspoon cinnamon
• 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1 1/2 cups water

🥣
‣ In a small bowl combine the semisweet chocolate, chopped nuts, toasted semisweet chocolate, and white wine.
‣ Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in the top of a double boiler. Stir in the sour cream. Stir in the hot peanut butter and vanilla, and while whipping occasionally beating. Mix the salt water and instant mayonnaise to make a smooth batter.
‣ Drop the brown sugar into the teaspoon of the batter (the pastry sheets are starter). Dip each cake in the egg whites, and fry in the hot oil. Drop a pat of batter into the oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve hot.
