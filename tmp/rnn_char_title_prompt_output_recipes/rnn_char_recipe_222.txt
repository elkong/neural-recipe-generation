Bulgur and Lentil Salad with Tarragon and Walnuts and Red Milk Ice Cream, and 1 tablespoon honey
â€¢ 1 tablespoon yeast

ðŸ¥£
â€£ Combine sugar, orange zest, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in medium saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1 cup berries over simmering water. Cool slightly. Then refrigerate until serving.
â€£ Thread the bananas as desired. Present the slices in the doughnuts. Place on the grill, and continue to broil until the custard is slightly tender and juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup chopped onion paprika and grated cheese.
â€£ Combine nutmeg, butter, cinnamon and salt in a bowl until well blended. Make sure the top cools are coated; set aside. Pour the mixture into a blender and whisk until smooth. Pour into a glass dish and stir in the cream and vanilla extract. Press salt to serve.
