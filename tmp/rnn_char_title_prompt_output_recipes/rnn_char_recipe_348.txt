â€£ Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 2 1/2 - 12 inch square baking dish. Crush the center of each zucchini and inside the pieces with a knife. Place in the center of a 9x13 inch pan. Arrange pears from the heat and remove all the pits. Prepare a grill with vegetable oil cooking spray. Fill with melted butter and sweet mustard powder. Sprinkle with sugar.
â€£ Place each of the whole parmesan cream cheese in the bottom of a large saucepan; pour about 3 or 4 or 5 tablespoons of apricot-shaped pasta sauce over each leaf. Repeat layering 2 batches. Cover surface over a piece of plastic wrap. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Stir and cook until the spinach mixture begins to bubble, stirring occasionally. Garnish with remaining cheese and fresh whipped cream.
