â€£ Pour off paste and squash enough to coat well. Add bay leaf and port wine. Cover and cook 5 minutes; season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
â€£ Stir in the ground beef, and simmer until the noodles are tender and the turkey is no longer pink, about 10 more minutes. Stir in the frozen peas and carrots and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped teaspoon and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spoon liquid out onto center of the casserole dish. Cut cream cheese mixture into wedges, and add the ketchup mixture. Serve immediately.
