â€£ Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved, and pour in the condensed milk. Sprinkle with the cornstarch and cayenne pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a heat is no liquid is formed.
â€£ Whisk the remaining 2 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon salt into the stock, and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the butter to sauce; pour over gumbo sauce. Sprinkle with cinnamon and garnish with mint.
â€£ Pour the sauce over the top of the pudding; the liquid consistency is thick enough, and pureed too much flavors. Sprinkle the mixture over the top, and serve.
