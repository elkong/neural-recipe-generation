â€£ Place the chicken breasts in a medium saucepan and cover with active dish. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat until the potatoes are soft, 5 to 9 minutes. Pour the sauce into the peas and simmer until the topping is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Drain the frozen broccoli and cucumbers. Mix the peanut butter and mustard powder together in a bowl. Stir in the peanut butter and pecans to the pasta until needed. Mix mayonnaise, available and croutons into the sauce mixture; stir until well blended.
â€£ Pour sauce over chicken and popcorn and chill before serving.
